VirtualPups is an app for viewing, favoriting and petting a selection of virtual dogs. You can view the list of dogs, view the info pages of individual dogs, 
enter your name and "pet" a dog (the info will be saved to Firebase database and displayed on the dog's page),
and mark one of the dogs as your favorite (the information will be saved to your phone's local storage). 

## How to configure: 
1. Download repository
2. Install dependencies with npm i command (Terminal)
3. Add API keys (in submission file) to firebase/Config.js (where it says "// add config info here")
4. Run the app with npx expo start command
